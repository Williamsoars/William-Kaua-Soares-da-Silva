# William Silva – Undergraduate Researcher in Graph Theory

---

## About Me
I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the **Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE), Brazil**.  
I am deeply interested in **graph theory**, **combinatorics**, and the study of **modular graphs**.

---

## Research
I am currently exploring **modular graphs**, a class of graphs defined by **modular arithmetic relations between vertices**.  
My research focuses on:  

- **Connectivity and robustness** of modular graphs  
- **Hamiltonicity and cycle formation**  
- **Structural properties** and decomposition of graphs  

This work is in progress, with open questions and preliminary results, aiming to connect modular graph structures to classical problems in graph theory.
